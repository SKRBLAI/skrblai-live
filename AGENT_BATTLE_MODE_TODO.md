## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 2A: Enable Orbit Mode** (5 min)
1. Change `ENABLE_ORBIT: true` in feature flags
2. Test existing orbit on `/agents` page
3. Verify Percy is centered correctly

### **Phase 2B: Create Battle Component** (30 min)
1. Create `components/agents/AgentLeagueBattle.tsx`
2. Split agents into two teams:
   - **Percy's Team**: Business agents (branding, social, content, publishing, etc.)
   - **SkillSmith's Team**: Sports agents (skillsmith, nutrition, training, etc.)
3. Layout:
   - Percy on left (large, glowing)
   - SkillSmith on right (large, glowing)
   - Agents arranged vertically behind their leaders
   - Animated "VS" in center with cosmic effects

### **Phase 2C: Add View Toggle** (15 min)
1. Create view switcher in `/agents` page:
   ```tsx
   <div className="view-toggle">
     <button onClick={() => setView('grid')}>
       📊 Grid View
     </button>
     <button onClick={() => setView('orbit')}>
       🌌 Orbit View
     </button>
     <button onClick={() => setView('battle')}>
       ⚔️ Battle Mode
     </button>
   </div>
   ```

2. Conditionally render based on view state
