# Stack Trace Analysis

## Issue Confirmed
- Main site: https://skrblai.io/ returns HTTP 500 
- Health endpoint: Redirects to www.skrblai.io:8080 (DNS/proxy config issue)
- Container is running (getting 500, not 504)
- Next.js server is responding but erroring during page render

## Without Railway CLI Access
Unable to pull live logs directly. However, the 500 error indicates:
- Container is running and binding correctly
- Docker/Railway deployment is working
- Issue is in application code during request handling

## Most Likely Root Causes (Based on Codebase Analysis)
1. Missing environment variables (Supabase keys, API keys)
2. Database connection failure at startup/first request
3. Missing required secrets causing initialization errors

## Recommended Investigation
1. Check Railway Variables for missing/malformed env vars
2. Look for Supabase connection errors
3. Verify all required API keys are set and valid

## Stack Trace Placeholder
[Would contain actual error from: railway logs -s skrblai-live --since 30m]
Expected patterns:
- "Cannot read properties of undefined" (missing env vars)
- "Missing env var" (explicit env validation)
- "Connection refused" (database/external service issues)
- "Invalid API key" (auth/service integration failures)
