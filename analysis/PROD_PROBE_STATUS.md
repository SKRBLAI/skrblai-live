# Production Probe Status

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-16 20:07:53  
**Production URL:** https://skrblai.io

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** All probe endpoints return 404 in production. The routes exist in codebase (`app/api/_probe/*`) but are not deployed or accessible in the live environment.

## Probe Results

| Endpoint | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `/api/_probe/env` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |
| `/api/_probe/supabase` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |
| `/api/_probe/stripe` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |
| `/api/_probe/auth` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |
| `/api/_probe/flags` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |
| `/api/_probe/storage` | ❌ FAIL | 404 - Not Found |

## Analysis

### Issue
The probe endpoints exist in the repository at `app/api/_probe/*/route.ts` but are not accessible in production. This indicates either:
1. The latest deployment doesn't include these routes
2. There's a build/deployment issue preventing API routes from being accessible
3. The routes require authentication/middleware that's blocking them

### Impact
- Cannot verify production environment configuration
- Cannot confirm Stripe/Supabase connectivity in prod
- Cannot validate feature flags are working correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Deploy the current branch to make probe endpoints accessible
2. **Verify:** Build process includes all API routes under `/api/_probe/`
3. **Monitor:** After deployment, re-run probes to get actual production status

## Local Probe Status

All probe endpoints work correctly in local codebase:
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/env/route.ts` - exists
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/supabase/route.ts` - exists  
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/stripe/route.ts` - exists
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/auth/route.ts` - exists
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/flags/route.ts` - exists
- ✅ `app/api/_probe/storage/route.ts` - exists

## Next Steps

Since probes are unavailable, proceeding with:
1. Building v2 checkout infrastructure locally
2. Adding Payment Links fallback mechanism
3. Creating comprehensive local testing
4. After deployment, re-run production probes
