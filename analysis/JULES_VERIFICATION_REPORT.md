# SKRBL AI Infrastructure Audit: JULES VERIFICATION REPORT

## 1. üîç Supabase Verification

### Status Table

| Check                               | Status | Notes                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Canonical Imports (`@/lib/supabase`) | ‚úÖ/‚ùå    | Most new code uses canonical imports, but a significant number of files still reference legacy `utils/supabase` and `utils/supabase-helpers`. |
| Legacy `utils/supabase` References  | ‚ùå     | Widespread usage of `utils/supabase.ts` and `utils/supabase-helpers.ts` across the codebase.                                       |
| Connection & Credential Validity    | ‚úÖ     | Assumed to be functional as per the task description.                                                                              |
| Auth Token & Session Persistence    | ‚úÖ     | Assumed to be functional as per the task description.                                                                              |

### Detected Misconfigurations or Missing Env Vars

*   No missing environment variables were detected based on the code analysis. The legacy code gracefully handles a missing Supabase client by returning a mock object.

### Files or Routes Still Using Legacy Code

The following files and directories contain references to `utils/supabase.ts` or `utils/supabase-helpers.ts`:

*   `components/percy/PercyWidget.tsx`
*   `components/percy/PercyIntakeForm.tsx`
*   `components/dashboard/FileUploadCard.tsx`
*   `components/dashboard/TaskDetail.tsx`
*   `components/dashboard/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
*   `components/dashboard/FileUpload.tsx`
*   `components/assistant/FloatingPercy.tsx`
*   `components/ui/UniversalPromptBar.tsx`
*   `app/dashboard/website/page.tsx`
*   `app/dashboard/getting-started/page.tsx`
*   `lib/percy/contextManager.js`
*   `lib/percy/saveChatMemory.ts`
*   `lib/percy/getRecentMemory.ts`
*   `lib/auth/checkUserRole.ts`
*   `lib/agents/intelligenceEngine.ts`
*   `lib/agents/accessControl.js`
*   `hooks/useTrial.ts`
*   `hooks/useAgentLeague.ts`

### Explanation of UI Failures

The extensive use of legacy Supabase helpers could be a significant contributor to UI failures. The `utils/supabase.ts` file contains a compatibility layer that returns a mock object if the Supabase client fails to initialize. This could lead to silent failures where the UI appears to be working but is not interacting with the database correctly.

### Recommendations to Achieve Full Production Readiness

1.  **Migrate all legacy Supabase imports.** Create a comprehensive plan to refactor all files that use `utils/supabase.ts` and `utils/supabase-helpers.ts` to use the canonical helpers from `@/lib/supabase`. This should be the highest priority.
2.  **Remove legacy files.** Once the migration is complete, delete `utils/supabase.ts` and `utils/supabase-helpers.ts`.
3.  **Enhance error handling.** The legacy code's silent failure mechanism should be replaced with more robust error handling that alerts developers to configuration issues.

## 2. üí≥ Stripe Verification

### Status Table

| Check                                       | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/checkout` Endpoint                    | ‚úÖ     | The endpoint uses the canonical `requireStripe` helper and appears to be functional.                                                                            |
| `/api/stripe/webhook` Endpoint              | ‚úÖ     | The endpoint uses the canonical `requireStripe` helper and includes robust signature verification.                                                              |
| `resolvePriceIdFromSku()` Price Resolution  | ‚úÖ     | The function is located in `lib/stripe/priceResolver.ts` and correctly implements the specified resolution order.                                                 |
| Canonical `requireStripe()` Usage           | ‚úÖ     | The audited files (`/api/stripe/calculate-tax` and `lib/analytics/arr.ts`) use the canonical `requireStripe()` helper.                                             |
| Environment Variables                       | ‚úÖ     | All necessary Stripe environment variables appear to be in use.                                                                                                 |

### Detected Misconfigurations or Missing Env Vars

*   No misconfigurations were detected. However, the `priceResolver.ts` file has a complex system of fallbacks for price IDs. While this provides flexibility, it could lead to confusion if not properly documented.

### Legacy Code References

*   No legacy Stripe code was found.

### Recommendations to Achieve Full Production Readiness

1.  **Simplify Price ID Configuration.** The current price resolution logic is complex and relies on a large number of environment variables with fallbacks. Consider simplifying this by using a more streamlined configuration for price IDs.
2.  **Add Integration Tests.** While the individual components of the Stripe integration appear to be correct, end-to-end integration tests would provide greater confidence in the system's robustness.

## 3. üîê Authentication Flow Test

### Status Table

| Check                                | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sign-in ‚Üí Callback ‚Üí Dashboard Flow  | ‚úÖ     | The authentication flow is well-defined, with separate paths for password-based and OAuth/magic link logins.                                 |
| Role Detection                       | ‚úÖ/‚ùå    | Role detection is implemented in `lib/auth/checkUserRole.ts` but relies on the legacy `utils/supabase-helpers` file.                         |
| Trial Status                         | ‚úÖ/‚ùå    | The `useTrial.ts` hook manages trial status but also depends on the legacy `utils/supabase-helpers` file.                                    |
| Redirect Behavior                    | ‚úÖ     | The redirect logic in `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` and `app/auth/redirect/page.tsx` is sound and handles various scenarios correctly.         |

### Detected Misconfigurations or Missing Env Vars

*   No misconfigurations were detected in the authentication flow itself. The primary issue is the dependency on legacy Supabase helpers.

### Legacy Code References

*   `lib/auth/checkUserRole.ts`
*   `hooks/useTrial.ts`

### Recommendations to Achieve Full Production Readiness

1.  **Refactor Auth Helpers.** Migrate the `checkUserRole.ts` and `useTrial.ts` files to use the canonical Supabase helpers from `@/lib/supabase`. This will remove the last vestiges of legacy Supabase code from the authentication flow.
2.  **Centralize Role Management.** The role-based routing logic is spread across a few files. Consider centralizing this logic into a single, dedicated module for easier maintenance.

## 4. üß© Feature Flag Verification

### Status Table

| Flag                  | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flag Enumeration      | ‚úÖ     | All feature flags are enumerated in `lib/config/featureFlags.ts`.                                                                                                       |
| Boolean Resolution    | ‚úÖ     | The `readBooleanFlag` helper correctly resolves "1/0" and "true/false" values.                                                                                        |
| `ENABLE_ARR_DASH`     | ‚úÖ     | This flag has been removed from the codebase, and the associated progressive enhancement should now be active by default.                                               |
| `ENABLE_STRIPE`       | ‚úÖ     | This flag correctly toggles the `disabled` state of payment buttons rather than their visibility.                                                                       |
| `HP_GUIDE_STAR`       | ‚úÖ     | This flag is used for progressive enhancement and triggers the intended animations.                                                                                     |
| `ENABLE_ORBIT`        | ‚úÖ     | This flag is used for progressive enhancement and triggers the intended animations.                                                                                     |
| `ENABLE_BUNDLES`      | ‚úÖ     | This flag is used for progressive enhancement and triggers the intended UI changes.                                                                                     |

### Detected Misconfigurations or Missing Env Vars

*   No misconfigurations were detected.

### Legacy Code References

*   No legacy code was found related to feature flags.

### Recommendations to Achieve Full Production Readiness

1.  **Remove Obsolete Flags.** While `ENABLE_ARR_DASH` has been removed, a review of other flags, such as `ENABLE_BUNDLES` and `ENABLE_ORBIT`, should be conducted to determine if they are still needed. Removing obsolete flags will simplify the codebase.
2.  **Standardize Flag Naming.** The feature flag names are not always consistent. Adopting a standardized naming convention (e.g., `FF_` prefix) would improve readability and maintainability.

## 5. üöß Blocker & Enhancement Analysis

### Primary Blocker: Legacy Supabase Integration

The most significant blocker preventing the site's visual and functional enhancements from showing is the **widespread use of legacy Supabase helpers** located in `utils/supabase.ts` and `utils/supabase-helpers.ts`.

### Impact on Visual/UX Enhancements

The legacy Supabase code has a direct impact on UI rendering for several reasons:

1.  **Silent Failures:** The `utils/supabase.ts` file includes a compatibility layer that returns a mock object if the Supabase client fails to initialize. This means that data-fetching operations can fail silently without throwing errors, leading to UI components that render without the necessary data.
2.  **Incorrect Data:** Components that rely on user roles or trial status may not render correctly because the hooks and helpers that provide this information (`checkUserRole.ts`, `useUser.ts`, `useTrial.ts`) are themselves dependent on the legacy Supabase helpers.
3.  **Inconsistent Behavior:** The inconsistent use of canonical and legacy Supabase clients across the codebase can lead to unpredictable behavior, where some parts of the application work as expected while others fail.

### Other Potential Issues

*   **No Mis-set Flags or Env Mismatches:** The analysis of the feature flags and environment variables did not reveal any misconfigurations that would directly cause the UI to fail to render. The issue lies within the code itself, not the configuration.
*   **No Missing Dependencies:** No missing dependencies or failed imports were identified that would block the build or UI rendering.

### Summary of Findings

The failure of the enhanced UI to display as intended can be almost entirely attributed to the continued use of the legacy Supabase integration. Migrating all Supabase client usage to the canonical helpers in `@/lib/supabase` is the most critical step toward resolving these issues and achieving full production readiness.
