# DOUBLE UP 108 — CURSOR (Backend/Logic/Data)

**Date:** 2025-06-04

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Agent Registry & Modal Logic
- **Audit:** All agents in `lib/agents/agentRegistry.ts` now have full backstory metadata (superpowers, catchphrase, nemesis, etc.) sourced from `agentBackstories.ts`.
- **Fixes:** Any missing or broken agent backstory fields were identified and repaired. All agents have `displayOrder` for V-formation/future visuals; `featured` flag can be added as needed.
- **Modal:** `AgentBackstoryModal.tsx` displays all backstory fields, including superpowers, catchphrase, nemesis, and origin story. Modal logic in `AgentConstellation.tsx` and related grids confirmed to work as intended.

### 2. Percy Recommendations Logic
- **Audit:** Percy onboarding and recommendation logic (in `PercyOnboarding.tsx`, `PercyWidget.tsx`, `PercyHero.tsx`, and `agentUtils.ts`) was reviewed and tested.
- **Fixes:** Recommendations now always match prompt context using `getBestAgents` and related logic. Highlighting of recommended agents is supported via UI flags (e.g., `selectedAgentId`, animation props in carousels).

### 3. Routing/Navigation Audit
- **Audit:** All main navigation and footer links were tested for dead/broken links. All onboarding CTAs and agent links route to `/services` or the correct dashboard page.
- **Fixes:** Any deprecated/legacy `/agents` references and code were removed. Confirmed all `Link` and `route` props are up to date in Navbar, AgentModal, AgentCard, and main pages.

### 4. Error Monitoring & Performance
- **Audit:** All main pages (home, services, agent detail, onboarding) tested for 404/blue screen errors. No unhandled errors found.
- **API:** Agent/feature modal API endpoints were reviewed for speed and reliability. Logging is present for onboarding flows and agent modal opens (see `systemLog`, `trackPercyEvent`, and mobile performance monitor utilities).
- **Performance:** Mobile and API performance monitoring is in place (`utils/mobilePerformanceMonitor.ts`, `/api/mobile/performance`).

### 5. Documentation

# DOUBLE UP 109.5 — CURSOR (Backend QA, Analytics, Performance)

**Date:** 2025-06-04

## Summary of Changes & QA

### 1. Agent/Story QA
- **Audit:** All agent backstories in `lib/agents/agentBackstories.ts` and registry (`lib/agents/agentRegistry.ts`) were re-validated. No "TBD" or missing fields found; all agents have complete metadata (superpowers, catchphrase, nemesis, etc.).
- **Modal Logic:** `AgentBackstoryModal.tsx` and `AgentConstellation.tsx` tested for modal open/close, story rendering, and registry data access. No bugs found; all fields render as expected.
- **API:** Agent modal API and registry endpoints confirmed to return full backstory data.

### 2. Onboarding & Recommendation Tracking
- **Analytics:** Percy onboarding analytics (`trackPercyEvent`, `trackPercyInteraction`) fire on prompt submit and agent recommendation. Recommended agent IDs and actions are logged for future personalization.
- **Highlighting:** Percy-triggered agent highlights are consistent and persist across navigation (via localStorage and context in `PercyProvider`, `PercyWidget`).

### 3. Navigation/Error Audit
- **Navigation:** All nav links, agent/feature links, and onboarding CTAs tested for dead ends, blue screens, or old logic. No issues found; all links route correctly.
- **Percy Chat:** Persistent Percy chat (`PersistentPercy`, `PercyProvider`, `PercyWidget`) tested from every page; backend context and logging confirmed.
- **Error Boundaries:** Error boundaries (`utils/mobilePerformanceMonitor.ts`, React error boundary integration) catch/report errors for both Percy and agent modal flows.

### 4. Performance/Analytics
- **Mobile Performance:** Mobile performance monitoring (`utils/mobilePerformanceMonitor.ts`) is active, logging Core Web Vitals, memory, and errors. No critical issues detected in recent logs.
- **API:** No slow API routes detected in current batch; performance logs and analytics are being collected for future review.

### 5. Documentation
