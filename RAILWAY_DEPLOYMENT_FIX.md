# Railway Deployment Fix

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened
- **Before commit 4089dc0**: Railway deployments worked via native GitHub integration (no CI/CD workflows)
- **After commit 4089dc0**: GitHub Actions workflows were introduced, breaking the Railway deployment process
- **Issue**: Railway CLI authentication failing in GitHub Actions

### The Problem
The Railway deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml`) was trying to:
1. Run `railway login --yes` (requires interactive auth or proper token setup)
2. Link project and set environment manually
3. Deploy via `railway up --ci`

But the Railway CLI wasn't properly authenticated with the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` environment variable.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Updated Railway Deployment Workflow
- Removed unnecessary `railway login`, `railway link`, and `railway environment` steps
- Simplified to direct `railway up --detach` command
- Properly configured environment variables for Railway CLI

### Required GitHub Repository Configuration

#### Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets)
```
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_api_token
```

#### Variables (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)  
```
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=your_railway_project_id
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=your_railway_environment_id
```

## 🚀 How to Get These Values

### 1. Railway Token
```bash
# Install Railway CLI locally
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Generate a token
railway auth
```

### 2. Project and Environment IDs
```bash
# List your projects
railway projects

# Connect to your project
railway link

# Show project info (will display IDs)
railway status
```

Or get them from Railway dashboard:
- Project ID: Found in Railway dashboard URL or project settings
- Environment ID: Found in environment settings (usually "production" environment)

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. **Set the required secrets and variables in GitHub**
2. **Push a commit to master branch**
3. **Check GitHub Actions tab for deployment status**
4. **Verify deployment at https://skrblai.io**

## 🔄 Alternative: Revert to Native Railway Integration

If you prefer the original working setup:

1. **Delete the GitHub Actions workflows**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .github/workflows/
   ```

2. **Re-enable Railway's native GitHub integration**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Enable auto-deploy on push to master

3. **Railway will handle deployments automatically** (like before commit 4089dc0)

## 📋 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fixed Railway CLI authentication in workflow**
2. 🔄 **Configure GitHub secrets and variables** 
3. 🧪 **Test deployment with a small commit**
4. 🚀 **Verify deployment success**

The deployment should now work properly with the updated Railway workflow configuration.
