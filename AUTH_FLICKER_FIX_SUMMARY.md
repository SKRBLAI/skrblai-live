# Auth Flicker Fix - Implementation Summary

**Branch:** `fix/auth-flicker`  
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Ready for Testing & PR

## Problem Statement

Authentication flicker was occurring when:
1. Visiting `/sign-in` while already signed in â†’ blue page flash before redirect
2. Visiting `/dashboard` while signed out â†’ client-side redirect causing flash
3. Auto-redirects triggering from public pages like `/`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. âœ… Middleware Scoping (Already Correct)
**File:** `middleware.ts`

- Confirmed middleware only matches `/dashboard/*` and `/admin/*`
- Does NOT match public routes (`/`, `/sign-in`, `/auth/*`, `/pricing`, etc.)
- This prevents middleware from causing redirects on public pages

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/dashboard/:path*',
    '/admin/:path*',
  ],
};
```

### 2. âœ… Server-Side Sign-In Page
**File:** `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'` to prevent caching
- Implemented inline server-side role-based redirect (removed dependency on `routeToDashboard` helper)
- Server component with `getServerSupabaseAnon().auth.getUser()` check
- If user exists, immediately redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role
- Only renders `<SignInForm />` when unauthenticated

**Key Code:**
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const revalidate = 0;
export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store';

export default async function SignInPage() {
  const supabase = getServerSupabaseAnon();
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  if (user) {
    // Server-side redirect based on role - no client-side flicker
    routeUserToDashboard(user.id);
  }

  return <SignInForm />;
}
```

### 3. âœ… SignInForm.tsx (Already Correct)
**File:** `app/(auth)/sign-in/SignInForm.tsx`

- Already a client component with only UI and handlers
- No `useEffect` that auto-redirects
- No client-side auth checks that cause flicker

### 4. âœ… No loading.tsx (Already Correct)
**Path:** `app/(auth)/sign-in/loading.tsx`

- File does not exist â†’ no loading splash before server redirect âœ“

### 5. âœ… Verified No Global AuthGate Patterns

**Checked Files:**
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - Only redirects on button click (user-initiated) âœ“
- `components/agents/AgentModal.tsx` - Only redirects on button click (user-initiated) âœ“
- `components/sports/SportsHero.tsx` - Only redirects on button click (user-initiated) âœ“
- `app/dashboard/DashboardWrapper.tsx` - Inside `/dashboard/*` (allowed per spec) âœ“

**Result:** No automatic client-side redirects from public pages found.

### 6. âœ… Build Test Passed

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result:** âœ… Compiled successfully - 68 pages generated

## What Was Changed

### Modified Files (1)
- `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` - Added `fetchCache`, implemented inline server-side redirect

### Unchanged (Already Correct)
- `middleware.ts` - Already scoped correctly
- `app/(auth)/sign-in/SignInForm.tsx` - Already client-only UI
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - No auto-redirects
- All other redirect patterns - Either user-initiated or inside `/dashboard/*`

## Testing Required

### Manual Verification Checklist

1. **Visit `/` while signed out**
   - Expected: Stay on homepage, no redirect
   - Test for: No flicker or auto-redirect

2. **Visit `/dashboard` while signed out**
   - Expected: Server redirect to `/sign-in` with no flash
   - Test for: No client-side loading spinner before redirect

3. **Visit `/sign-in` while signed in**
   - Expected: Instant server redirect to role-based dashboard
   - Test for: No blue page flicker or loading screen

4. **Sign in via password**
   - Expected: Form submits, redirects to role dashboard
   - Test for: Smooth transition, no double-redirect

5. **Sign in via Google OAuth**
   - Expected: OAuth flow completes, redirects to role dashboard
   - Test for: No flicker after callback

6. **Sign in via magic link**
   - Expected: Link clicked, redirects to role dashboard
   - Test for: No flicker after auth callback

## Implementation Notes

### Why Not Use `routeToDashboard` Helper?
The existing `routeToDashboard` helper was designed to check auth first, then redirect. Since we're already checking auth in the page component, we implemented the redirect logic inline to avoid an extra layer of abstraction and ensure the redirect happens immediately at the server component level.

### Why `fetchCache = 'force-no-store'`?
This ensures the sign-in page is never cached, so the server-side auth check always runs with fresh session data. Without this, a cached version might render briefly before the client realizes the user is authenticated.

### Middleware Scope Rationale
By scoping middleware to ONLY `/dashboard/*` and `/admin/*`, we ensure:
- Public pages load without any auth checks
- No redirect loops from public pages
- Middleware only protects actual protected routes
- Home page stays accessible without flicker

## Next Steps

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Build test
npm run build

# Local dev test
npm run dev

# Production test
npm run start
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D fix/auth-flicker
```

The changes are minimal and isolated to `sign-in/page.tsx`, making rollback safe and easy.
