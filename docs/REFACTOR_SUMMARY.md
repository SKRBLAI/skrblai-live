## 🔧 **Key Changes Implemented**

### **1. Container & Layout Structure**
✅ **Before:** Excessive nested containers with multiple wrapper divs causing "stacking" issues  
✅ **After:** Clean Services-pattern container structure:
```tsx
<motion.div className="min-h-screen relative">
  <div className="relative z-10 pt-16 sm:pt-20 lg:pt-24 px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-12">
```

### **2. Hero Section Alignment**
✅ **Services Pattern Applied:**
- Live activity badges positioned identically
- CosmicHeading with consistent sizing and spacing  
- Percy integration with image and context text
- Mobile-safe text handling with `mobile-text-safe no-text-cutoff` classes

### **3. Grid Layout Standardization**
✅ **Contact Page:**
- Quick contact methods: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 max-w-5xl mx-auto mb-16`
- Priority options: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto mb-16`

✅ **Features Page:**
- Features grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto mb-16`

### **7. Percy Integration**
