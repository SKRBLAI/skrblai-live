# DOUBLE UP 202 — Unified Percy Dashboard Auth Portal (Sign In/Up + Promo/VIP)

**Date:** 2025-06-06

## New Feature: Unified Percy Sign In/Sign Up + Promo/VIP Code Portal

### Overview
- Created a single, glassmorphic Percy-branded authentication portal at `/sign-in`.
- All unauthenticated traffic to `/dashboard` or protected sub-routes is now redirected to this unified portal.
- Integrated Supabase OAuth (Google) and Magic Link (passwordless) sign-in options.
- Retained standard email/password sign-in.
- Added fields for one-time promo codes or VIP codes.

**File Changes:**
- `app/sign-in/page.tsx` — New route, mounts the unified auth portal
- `components/percy/PercyOnboardingAuth.tsx` — The core UI component for the sign-in/sign-up form.
- `hooks/useDashboardAuth.ts` — Enhanced hook to provide detailed user session and access level data.
- `lib/auth/dashboardAuth.ts` — Backend logic for fetching user roles, VIP status, and permissions.
- `middleware.ts` — Updated to enforce the new redirect logic.
- `app/dashboard/signin/page.tsx` (deleted)

### Objective 2: Debug & Harden Authentication Flow

**Problem:** The previous authentication flow was inconsistent. Users could sometimes access parts of the dashboard without a valid session, and redirects were unreliable. The new VIP/promo code system also needed to be integrated at the auth level.

### Objective 3: VIP & Access Level System

**Problem:** We needed a way to grant different access levels (e.g., "Free", "Standard", "VIP") to users, unlocking specific features. This needed to be tied to their authentication state.

### User Flow
1. **Step 1:** Sign In or Sign Up (email, password, confirm password for sign up)
2. **Step 2:** Promo/VIP Code entry (optional, with clear feedback for valid/invalid/used codes)
3. **Step 3:** Dashboard preview (VIP users see badge and premium visuals)

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/sign-in/page.tsx` — New route, mounts the unified auth portal
- `components/percy/PercyOnboardingAuth.tsx` — New component, all-in-one UI and state logic

### UX/Design
- Glassmorphic, cosmic, Percy-branded styling throughout
- Responsive, mobile-first layout
- Percy avatar always visible
- Clear feedback for all states (processing, error, success)
- VIP dashboard is visually distinct (badge, color, cosmic Percy flair)

### Future-Proofing
- Dummy code validation logic is isolated and ready for backend integration
- User can add promo/VIP codes later from profile/settings
- All state logic is extensible for future features

### For Windsurf & Cursor Teams
- **Windsurf:** Frontend is complete, ready for handoff
- **Cursor:** Backend hooks can be wired in for real code validation, user upgrades, and dashboard gating

# DOUBLE UP 111 — Percy Onboarding Fusion + UI Cohesion Release

**Date:** 2025-06-05

## Migration Log: Percy Onboarding Consolidation (June 2025)

### What Was Migrated to `UnifiedPercyOnboarding.tsx`
- **Analytics event tracking:** All onboarding prompt and file upload analytics (`trackPercyEvent`) are now triggered at user actions (prompt submit, file upload, onboarding complete). See legacy: `components/home/PercyOnboarding.tsx`, `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **File upload handler:** Real file upload logic (including drag-and-drop), intent setting, and analytics are implemented. See legacy: `components/home/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **Onboarding state persistence:** Onboarding completion is persisted to both localStorage and Supabase (`user_settings` upsert), with error handling and fallbacks. See legacy: `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **System logging:** All onboarding completion/systemLog logic is present and triggers on onboarding completion. See legacy: `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **Goal-to-dashboard routing:** Mapping logic for personalized routing (goal → dashboard route) is unified and used for onboarding completion. See legacy: `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **Fallbacks and error handling:** All meaningful error/fallback handlers from both legacy flows have been preserved and merged.

### What Was NOT Migrated
- **Invite code gating:** Not migrated. Deprecated unless explicitly requested. See `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.
- **Agent selection:** Not migrated. No active requirement. See `components/percy/PercyOnboarding.tsx`.

### Documentation and Helper Extraction
- All migrated logic is commented as legacy-to-unified with references to original files/lines.
- `/utils/percyHelpers.ts` created for future shared helpers. No helpers have been moved yet; document here if/when any are extracted.

### Overlaps and Omissions
- All unique onboarding flows, analytics, state, logging, and routing from both legacy files are now unified.
- No business logic, state, or analytics flows were lost. All error handling and fallbacks preserved.
- Accessibility lints identified and will be addressed in the next pass.

## BATCH FIX: Type/interface and Subscription Cleanup - 2025-06-06

**Objective**: Batch-fix all TypeScript type/interface and subscription errors to ensure clean builds.

**Summary of Fixes**:

1. **Unknown Properties & Interface Updates**:

    - Added `rateLimited?: boolean;` to `DashboardAuthResponse` interface in `lib/auth/dashboardAuth.ts` to allow returning this field from authentication functions.
    - Added `isSignup?: boolean` to the `metadata` parameter type of the `logSignInAttempt`, `logSignInSuccess`, `logSignInFailure`, and `logPromoRedemption` functions in `lib/auth/authAuditLogger.ts`.
    - Added `event?: string` to the `metadata` parameter type of the `logSecurityViolation` function in `lib/auth/authAuditLogger.ts`.
    - Added `'system_health_check'` to the `eventType` union in the `AuthAuditEvent` interface in `lib/auth/authAuditLogger.ts` to support health check logging.
    - Added `recentActivity: []` to the `AuthDebugInfo` object initialization in `AuthIntegrationSupport.debugUserAuth` in `lib/auth/integrationSupport.ts` to fulfill interface requirements.

2. **Subscription Cleanup (`unsubscribe` calls)**:

    - Updated Supabase subscription cleanup logic in the following files to explicitly check if `subscription && typeof subscription.unsubscribe === 'function'` before calling `subscription.unsubscribe()`:
        - `hooks/useDashboardAuth.ts`
        - `utils/auth.ts`
        - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
    - This ensures that `unsubscribe` is only called if it exists and is a function, preventing runtime errors.

**Files Modified**:

- `lib/auth/dashboardAuth.ts`
  - Added `rateLimited?: boolean` to `DashboardAuthResponse` interface.

- `lib/auth/authAuditLogger.ts`
  - Added `isSignup?: boolean` to `metadata` parameter in `logSignInAttempt`, `logSignInSuccess`, `logSignInFailure`, and `logPromoRedemption`.
  - Added `event?: string` to `metadata` parameter in `logSecurityViolation`.
  - Added `'system_health_check'` to `eventType` in `AuthAuditEvent` interface.

- `hooks/useDashboardAuth.ts`
  - Modified `useEffect` cleanup function for `onAuthStateChange` subscription.

- `utils/auth.ts`
  - Modified cleanup function for `onAuthStateChanged` subscription.

- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Modified `useEffect` cleanup function for `onAuthStateChanged` subscription.

- `lib/auth/integrationSupport.ts`
  - Added `recentActivity: []` to `AuthDebugInfo` initialization in `debugUserAuth`.

**Verification**:

- `npx tsc --noEmit` completed successfully with zero type errors.
- `npm run build` completed successfully.

## Key Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/services/page.tsx`
- `app/pricing/page.tsx`
- `components/agents/AgentConstellation.tsx`
- `components/ui/BrandLogo.tsx`
- `components/layout/NavBar.tsx`

## Outstanding Issues

**Role:** SKRBL AI Data Security & Validation Architect  
**Mission:** Backend and validation logic for dashboard sign-in, promo code, and VIP handling

## Summary of Implementation ✅

### 1. Supabase Schema - Promo Code & VIP System
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250104_promo_vip_system.sql`
- **promo_codes table:** Complete with type (PROMO/VIP), usage limits, expiration, benefits JSONB
- **user_dashboard_access table:** Tracks user access levels (free/promo/vip) and benefits
- **Enhanced vip_users table:** Extended existing VIP system with promo code integration
- **Security:** Row-level security policies, proper permissions, service role access
- **Sample Data:** Test promo codes: WELCOME2025, VIP_PREVIEW, BETA_TESTER
- **Database Function:** `redeem_promo_code()` handles validation and redemption logic

### 2. Auth Logic - Core Authentication System  
**File:** `lib/auth/dashboardAuth.ts`
- **Main Function:** `authenticateForDashboard()` - Complete email/password + promo/VIP validation
- **Code Validation:** `validateAndRedeemCode()` - Handles both PROMO and VIP codes
- **VIP Integration:** `checkVIPStatus()` - Links with existing VIP recognition system
- **Security Features:** Input validation, SQL injection protection, error handling
- **Analytics:** `logAuthEvent()` - Tracks auth events for user journey analytics

### 3. API Endpoint - Dashboard Sign-in  
**File:** `app/api/auth/dashboard-signin/route.ts`  
- **POST Endpoint:** Accepts email, password, promoCode, vipCode
- **Input Validation:** Email format, code format, required field checks  
- **GET Endpoint:** Code validation without authentication (for UX)
- **Response Structure:** Standardized JSON with user data, access level, benefits
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging:** Detailed authentication attempt logging for security monitoring

### 4. Testing - Comprehensive Test Suite

## Test Coverage

- ✅ Basic authentication (valid/invalid credentials)
- ✅ Promo code validation (valid/invalid/expired/limit reached)  
- ✅ VIP code validation and user upgrade
- ✅ VIP status checking (existing/new users)
- ✅ Combined auth scenarios (VIP + promo)
- ✅ Error handling (database errors, malformed input)
- ✅ Security testing (SQL injection, edge cases)
- ✅ Concurrent usage scenarios

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `supabase/migrations/20250104_promo_vip_system.sql` - Database schema
- `lib/auth/dashboardAuth.ts` - Core authentication logic  
- `app/api/auth/dashboard-signin/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `tests/auth/dashboardAuth.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

### No Files Modified:
- All implementations are self-contained in new files
- No existing codebase modifications required
- Ready for UI integration by Windsurf team

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **UI Components:** Dashboard sign-in form with promo code field
2. **Access Control:** Check `accessLevel` in dashboard components  
3. **Benefits Display:** Show user benefits based on redeemed codes
4. **Admin Panel:** Manage promo codes (create/expire/monitor usage)
5. **Analytics Dashboard:** View auth success rates and code redemption metrics

## Security Considerations for Production

1. **Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to sign-in endpoint
2. **CAPTCHA:** Consider CAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts
3. **Session Management:** Implement proper session timeout/refresh
4. **Audit Trail:** Expand logging for compliance requirements
5. **Code Generation:** Secure promo code generation system

# DOUBLE UP 109.5 — CURSOR (Backend QA, Analytics, Performance)

**Date:** 2025-06-04

## Summary of Changes & QA

### 1. Agent/Story QA
- **Audit:** All agent backstories in `lib/agents/agentBackstories.ts` and registry (`lib/agents/agentRegistry.ts`) were re-validated. No "TBD" or missing fields found; all agents have complete metadata (superpowers, catchphrase, nemesis, etc.).
- **Modal Logic:** `AgentBackstoryModal.tsx` and `AgentConstellation.tsx` tested for modal open/close, story rendering, and registry data access. No bugs found; all fields render as expected.
- **API:** Agent modal API and registry endpoints confirmed to return full backstory data.

### 2. Onboarding & Recommendation Tracking
- **Analytics:** Percy onboarding analytics (`trackPercyEvent`, `trackPercyInteraction`) fire on prompt submit and agent recommendation. Recommended agent IDs and actions are logged for future personalization.
- **Highlighting:** Percy-triggered agent highlights are consistent and persist across navigation (via localStorage and context in `PercyProvider`, `PercyWidget`).

### 3. Navigation/Error Audit
- **Navigation:** All nav links, agent/feature links, and onboarding CTAs tested for dead ends, blue screens, or old logic. No issues found; all links route correctly.
- **Percy Chat:** Persistent Percy chat (`PersistentPercy`, `PercyProvider`, `PercyWidget`) tested from every page; backend context and logging confirmed.
- **Error Boundaries:** Error boundaries (`utils/mobilePerformanceMonitor.ts`, React error boundary integration) catch/report errors for both Percy and agent modal flows.

### 4. Performance/Analytics
- **Mobile Performance:** Mobile performance monitoring (`utils/mobilePerformanceMonitor.ts`) is active, logging Core Web Vitals, memory, and errors. No critical issues detected in recent logs.
- **API:** No slow API routes detected in current batch; performance logs and analytics are being collected for future review.

### 5. Documentation
- **Update:** This DoubleUp.md file now includes a detailed log of all backend QA, analytics, fixes, and performance/analytics upgrades for DOUBLE UP 109.5 — CURSOR.
