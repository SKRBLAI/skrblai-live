# Agent Card Replacement - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. Updated `components/ui/AgentLeagueCard.tsx`:
   - Replaced the old card implementation with the new one using `Agents-{slug}-Buttons.png` format
   - Added support for LEARN, CHAT, LAUNCH buttons
   - Improved error handling with fallbacks to webp format and default card
   - Preserved flip animation and backstory view
   - Maintained accessibility features

2. Updated `components/agents/AgentLeagueDashboard.tsx`:
   - Added the `handleAgentLaunch` function to support the new LAUNCH button
   - Updated the component to properly pass all necessary handlers to AgentLeagueCard
   - Added proper logging to track user interactions

## Implementation Details

- The card frame assets follow the naming pattern: `/images/Agents-{slug}-Buttons.png`
- Each card automatically determines its correct frame asset based on the agent's slug
- Fallbacks are implemented to handle missing assets:
  - First tries PNG format
  - Falls back to WEBP if PNG is missing
  - Uses a default frame if neither format is available
- Buttons are correctly positioned at the bottom of each frame

## Button Functionality

- **LEARN**: Opens the agent's backstory page or flips the card to show backstory details
- **CHAT**: Triggers the agent chat functionality 
- **LAUNCH**: Primary action to launch the agent's specific workflow
  - First tries agent's route if available
  - Falls back to API call to `/api/agents/{agentId}/launch`
  - Falls back to handoff functionality if launch fails

## Files That Could Be Removed/Deprecated (For Approval)

1. `/public/images/card-agents1.png` - Old card frame asset
2. `/public/images/card-agents2.png` - Old card frame asset
3. Any legacy cosmic button components that were only used for agent cards

## Future Optimizations

1. Consider implementing a sprite sheet or SVG-based approach for the buttons to reduce HTTP requests
2. Add analytics tracking for button interactions to measure user engagement
3. Consider lazy-loading agent cards that are below the fold to improve performance

## Testing Required

1. Verify all agent cards display correctly with their appropriate frame assets
2. Test all three button actions on each agent card
3. Verify animations work correctly on different devices and browsers
4. Confirm accessibility features work (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
5. Test fallback scenarios (missing images, network errors, etc.)
